    <h2>A collection of recipes for kuantha</h2>
    <p>"Kuantha Firfir" is a popular Ethiopian dish made with injera, a traditional Ethiopian flatbread. It is a variation of the dish called "Kitcha Firfir."</p>
    <h3>Ingredients. Kuantha Firfir is typically enjoyed as a breakfast or brunch dish in Ethiopia. It's a hearty and flavorful dish that is often served alongside other Ethiopian dishes like scrambled eggs (known as "Kai Wot") and spicy lentil stew (known as "Misir Wot").</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4-6 pieces of injera (Ethiopian flatbread)</li>
          <li>1 cup berbere sauce (a spicy Ethiopian spice blend)</li>
          <li>1 cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced clarified butter), or substitute with regular butter</li>
          <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
          <li>Salt to taste</li>
          <li>Water (as needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions or steps to do the above food</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tear the injera into small pieces and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large pan over medium heat and add the niter kibbeh or butter. Once melted, add the chopped onion and saut√© until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Add the berbere sauce to the pan and stir well to combine with the onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Gradually add water to the pan, starting with 1/2 cup and increasing as needed to create a thick but pourable sauce consistency. Stir well to ensure the sauce is evenly mixed.</li>
        <li>Add the torn injera to the pan and gently mix it with the sauce. The injera will absorb the flavors and soften. Cook for a few more minutes until the injera is heated through.</li>
        <li>Taste the dish and season with salt as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve the Kuantha Firfir hot, garnished with your choice of optional toppings such as chopped hard-boiled eggs, crumbled feta cheese, chopped tomatoes, and green onions.</li>
