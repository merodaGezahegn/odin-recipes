    <h2>Ethiopian Doro Wot</h2>
    <p>To prepare Ethiopian Doro Wot, a delicious spicy chicken stew, you will need the following ingredients:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
   <li>2 pounds (approx. 1 kg) chicken pieces (preferably bone-in, such as drumsticks or thighs)</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
   <li>tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
   <li>Hard-boiled eggs (optional)</li>
   <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped</li>
 </ul>
    <h3>Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make Ethiopian Doro Wot:</h3>
    <ol>
        

        <li>Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, lemon juice, and berbere spice. Mix well, ensuring the chicken is evenly coated. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate overnight for more intense flavors.
        </li>
     <li>   Heat the clarified butter: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt the clarified butter over medium heat.
    </li>
      <li>  Sauté the onions, garlic, and ginger: Add the finely chopped onions to the pot and sauté until they become soft and translucent. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook for an additional minute.
    </li> 
       <li> Add the spices: Add the berbere spice, paprika, cardamom, coriander, cumin, fenugreek, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the pot. Stir well to coat the onions, garlic, and ginger with the spices. Cook for a couple of minutes to toast the spices and release their flavors.
    </li>
       <li> Add the chicken: Place the marinated chicken pieces into the pot, along with any excess marinade. Stir to coat the chicken with the spice mixture. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the chicken to brown slightly.
    </li>
       <li> Incorporate the liquid: Pour in the chicken broth or water and add the tomato paste. Stir well to combine, ensuring the tomato paste is evenly distributed. Season with salt to taste.
    </li>
       <li> Simmer the stew: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the stew simmer gently for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and to ensure the chicken cooks evenly. The stew is ready when the chicken is tender and the flavors have melded together.
    </li>
       <li> Garnish and serve: Once the stew is cooked, remove it from the heat. You can garnish the Doro Wot with hard-boiled eggs, sliced in half if desired, and sprinkle fresh chopped cilantro or parsley over the top.
    </li>
       <li> Serving suggestion: Ethiopian Doro Wot is traditionally served with injera, a sourdough flatbread. If you have access to injera, place it on a platter and ladle the stew over it. Alternatively, you can serve Doro Wot with rice, bread, or any other preferred accompaniment.
    </li>
