    <h2>A collection of recipes for Kitfo </h2>
    <p>Ethiopian kitfo is a traditional dish that is popular in Ethiopian cuisine, particularly in the Gurage and Addis Ababa regions. 
        It is made from minced raw beef, typically taken from the leaner cuts such as sirloin or tenderloin. 
        Kitfo is often considered a delicacy and is commonly served on special occasions or as part of a festive meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>1 pound of lean beef (tenderloin or sirloin), finely minced</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons of clarified butter (niter kibbeh)</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon of mitmita spice blend (can be adjusted according to taste)</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of salt (adjust to taste)</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of ground cardamom</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of ground coriander</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
           <li>Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lime or lemon</li>
           <li>Injera or bread, for serving></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions or steps to do the above food</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by mincing the beef finely. You can use a sharp knife or a meat grinder to achieve a fine texture. Ensure that the beef is fresh and of high quality.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the minced beef, salt, cardamom, coriander, and cumin. Mix well, ensuring the spices are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat the clarified butter (niter kibbeh) in a skillet over medium heat until melted. Add the mitmita spice blend and stir it into the butter for a minute or two, allowing the flavors to infuse.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and let the spiced butter cool down slightly.</li>
        <li>Pour the spiced butter over the minced beef mixture and mix thoroughly until all the ingredients are well combined</li>
        <li>Add the freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice to the mixture and mix it in. Lime or lemon juice helps to tenderize the meat and adds a tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Taste the kitfo mixture and adjust the seasoning according to your preference. You can add more salt, spices, or lime/lemon juice if desired.</li>
        <li>Traditionally, kitfo is served raw, but if you prefer a slightly cooked version, you can quickly sauté the mixture in a hot skillet for a minute or two. However, it's important to note that consuming raw or undercooked meat carries certain health risks, so ensure you use fresh, high-quality beef from a trusted source.</li>
    <li>Transfer the kitfo to a serving plate and garnish with finely chopped onions, freshly chopped herbs, and Ayib (Ethiopian cottage cheese) if desired.</li>
    <li>Serve the kitfo immediately with injera or bread. To eat, tear off a piece of injera, scoop up some kitfo, and enjoy the flavorful combination.</li>
